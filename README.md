# UFOs
The purpose of this project is to create a website that displays UFO-sightings data with filter function. The users can filter multiple creteria at the same time.
* using HTML/CSS and bootstrap to display data that was stored in a js file. 
* using JavaScript to add this data to the website in a table format while being able to filter through it with the user's input.
* Web scraping-HTML

# Results
The website that allowed for five different categories to filter the data: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO was created for users as follows:

* How to use filter function: the user should click on the input boxes provided to the left and enter a valid text for the category to be filtered. If the users enter an incorrect fitler or a variable that does not exist in the data, no results will be shown.

* To come back to the original dataset (without filters included) click on the top left where it says UFO Sightings and the data will be reset.

** Filter sample with one category: filter city name "el cajon"

** Filter sampe with more than one categories: for example, filter city name "el cajon" with "triangle" shape.

# Summary
One drawback for this website is that the filter function should be built as a list rather than text input. The users should pick one in the given list rather than inputing information. It will cause problems when the input informaion is not accurate and of course, no result will be found.
